# Example Application
This is a step-by-step tutorial to set up an Elasticsearch Application with the fairsearch plug-in on your local machine.
We highly recommend to read [FA*IR: A Fair Top-k Ranking Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368) before you go through this tutorial since we will not explain the theory behind the plugin in this tutorial.

### Install Elasticsearch
The first thing we need is Elasticsearch. Download [Elasticsearch 6.2.4](https://www.elastic.co/de/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-2-4).
