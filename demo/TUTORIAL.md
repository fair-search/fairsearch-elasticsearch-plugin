This is a step-by-step tutorial to set up an Elasticsearch Application with the fairsearch plug-in on your local machine.
We highly recommend to read [FA*IR: A Fair Top-k Ranking Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368) before you go through this tutorial since we will not explain the theory behind the plugin in this tutorial.

Furthermore, you can also Download and Install the Data Transparency Lab (DTL) Demo-Version for a more pleasing user experience. The DTL-Demo-Version works very similar to the example described in this Tutorial but with a more sophisticated GUI and a larger set of test-data as well as the possibility to enter a search query in a text field and use custom parameters.
