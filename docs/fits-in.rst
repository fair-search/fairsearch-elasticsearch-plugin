How does the plugin fit in?
******************************

In :doc:`core-concepts` we mentioned the different building parts of this plugin, in this section we are going to
describe where to this plugin fits in.

=======================
What the plugin does
=======================

People search engines, as a main example of this plugin application, are not aware of the biases the traditional algorithms
for search (aka TF/IDF or BM25) might be introducing in their search results. This will reduce the visibility of already
disadvantaged groups corresponding to a legally protected category such as people with disabilities, racial or
ethnic minorities, or an under-represented gender in a specic industry).

This plugin is here to help your search produce a fair ranking given one legally-protected attribute, i.e.,
a ranking in which the representation of the minority group does not fall below a minimum proportion p at any point in the ranking,
while the utility of the ranking is maintained as high as possible.
