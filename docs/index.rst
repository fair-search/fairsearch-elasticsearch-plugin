Fairsearch Plugin for Elasticsearch
===================================

The *Fairsearch* plug-in for Elasticsearch is an implementation of the `FA*IR algorithm <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368>`_. It enables you to apply a *positive action* policy in which elements are re-ranked to ensure a fair representation of minorities or disadvantaged people.

This plugin has been developed by Pere Urb√≥n in collaboration with researchers at TU Berlin and Pompeu Fabra University, with  support from a grant by the `Data Transparency Lab <http://datatransparencylab.org/dtl2017_program_fair/>`_.

Get started
-------------------------------

- Check whether this plug-in is for you: :doc:`motivation`
- Understand the fairness criterion applied: :doc:`fairness_criterion`.
- Build an M table to apply the criterion: :doc:`building_the_mtable`
- Use the plug-in to perform a re-ranking: :doc:`reranking_using_fair`

Installing
-----------

Pre-built versions can be found `here <https://fair-search.github.io/>`_. Want a build for an ES version? Follow the instructions in the `README for building <https://github.com/fair-search/fairsearch-elasticsearch-plugin#development>`_ or `create an issue <https://github.com/fair-search/fairsearch-elasticsearch-plugin/issues>`_. Once you've found a version compatible with your Elasticsearch, you'd run a command such as:

    ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install \
    https://fair-search.github.io/fair-reranker/fairsearch-1.0-es6.1.2-SNAPSHOT.zip

(It's expected you'll confirm some security exceptions, you can pass -b to elasticsearch-plugin to automatically install)


Heeelp!
